    <h2>Torta de Milanesa de Pollo</h2>
    <p>This is a Mexican-inspired version of cotoletta alla Milanese, served on a bun and dressed with Mexican-style fixings. </p>
    <p>Spicy breaded chicken breast gets sandwiched between a toasted Mexican bun and then topped with spicy spread, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and pickled vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>⅓ cup bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pasos</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Seal chicken breast in a resealable zip-top plastic bag. Pound flat to 1/4-inch thickness. Add cornstarch and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken breast through egg; leave it in the bowl. Add bread crumbs, cilantro, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and pepper to the bag; shake well. Lift chicken from the bowl, letting any excess egg drip off. Add to bread crumb mixture. Shake and press seasoned bread crumbs over chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Place bolillo buns in the preheated oven until warmed through and toasted, about 12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
